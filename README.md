Hello!

I'm Amin, a Information Technology student based in Viet Nam.

I have a solid understanding of software fundamentals and focus more on analytical thinking, system understanding, and problem analysis than on coding.

I use AI as a supporting tool to help translate ideas into code and explore solutions more efficiently.

My interests lie in turning ideas into practical products, understanding system behavior, and improving software through testing and validation.

I don't aim to be a hardcore developer, but I enjoy understanding how things work and applying technology in meaningful ways.

I'm not proficient in every tool or programming language, but I'm always willing to learn and flexibly integrate new technologies to solve problems.

I have an open and adaptable mindset and feel comfortable working across different environments and approaches.

I’m especially interested in forward-looking ideas with long-term technological potential.

I see GitHub as a place to document my learning process, experiments, and growth.
