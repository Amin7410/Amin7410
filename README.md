Hello!
I'm Amin, an IT student based in Viet Nam.

I'm interested in system thinking, problem analysis, and building practical solutions.

I use AI as a tool to explore ideas and improve efficiency.

GitHub is where I document my learning and experiments.

Feel free to contact me anytime! I'm open to ideas and collaboration.
